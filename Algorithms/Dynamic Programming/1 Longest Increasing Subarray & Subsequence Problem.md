# 1.1 Longest Ascending Subarray
Given an unsorted array, find the length of the longest subarray in which the numbers are in ascending order.

Assumptions
<br>The given array is not null

Examples
<br>{7, 2, 3, 1, 5, 8, 9, 6}, longest ascending subarray is {1, 5, 8, 9}, length is 4.
<br>{1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5}, longest ascending subarray is {1, 2, 3}, length is 3.
